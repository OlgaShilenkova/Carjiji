- Which project you chose and why
  
  Everyone chose their top 3 projects and everyone was interested in the buy/sell 
  listing website.

- What tech stack did we use?

  We used nodeJS, express for back end.
  For design we used bootstrap and some sass.
  For databases we used PostgreSQL.
  Used git for version control and github to store our repositories.

— What each of you did, individually

  We didn't split the parts up in terms of front-end or back-end. We all worked on a lot of features together by pair programming and collaborations.

— Show us what you built (demo the app and show us the features)

  - DEMO here.

After demo:
— What challenges you had and how you overcame them

  Design planning takes a LOT more time than expected. The wireframes and ERD helped guide us throughout the project.
  Colloborating through git and the git flow. Overcame through: assisting each other as a group.
  Mistakes were made.

- What we learned/would do different

  Importance of having a Dev lead that takes a bigger picture/holistic view of everthing.
